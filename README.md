## What is this?

This site is meant to be everything Derick Gomez.

There are three main areas on the site: Home (Portfolio Page), Terminal, and Blog. The following sections provide an overview of each area and its features.



### Home (Portfolio)

This page features multiple sections that provide information about me.



Hero Section - Name and profile picture followed by a small intro



About Section - Gives some more background on who I am and aspire to be



Skills - All skills I currently possess and practice on a regular basis



Projects - All projects I have worked on and feature tiles that the user may interact with to view more info over said projects and navigate to the project if it is hosted online.



Experience - any past experiences I would like to showcase to showcase my abilities



Resume - Allow the user to view my current resume



Contact - Allow for the user to send me an email in case they would like to contact me.



### Terminal



This page is meant to showcase more of my artistic side. By running certain commands, the user can watch videos I have uploaded and/or listen to audio I have created. I have also made it so it may showcase photos or navigate the user to another site.

This is also how users can navigate to my blog. Some common terminal commands are:



`Chisholm` shows a music video I helped create for a friend's first song film within Chisholm Hall in 2022.



`Someone to be` is an instrumental for a song I was working on in 2023.



`Remember` plays a song I helped produce for a friend in 2023.



`blog` navigates the user to my blog.



### Blog

Due to my wanting a bit more control over what's public on the internet, I have created a blog page to provide those I choose with more insight into my life. Talking more about personal events and my true opinions behind them, and how I may have perceived them. I also have it so certain users have more access to a more unfiltered version of said site. The blog page also features an admin dashboard to control the site as a whole. From this dashboard, I am able to manage the whole home / portfolio page. Such as changing and uploading the images for each of the sections. As well as updating the text descriptions. I can modify the projects shown under the projects tab and modify each of the tiles' contents as well. It also features the ability to manage the blog post, users, Terminal commands, and bug reports. The admin dashboard serves as the control panel for the whole site.
